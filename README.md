This repository contains some of the projects discussed and implemented during the sessions of the VHDL Design Club, organized by Digilent Cluj-Napoca. The projects were developed using Basys 3 as an FPGA development board.
As for now, the repository contains two projects: 
- Countdown Timer - a 10-seconds countdown timer (needs further improvement)
- VGA Controller - a program that generates the signals needed for displaying hte Olympic Circles Logo via the VGA port.
